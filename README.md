# WaLLy3K's GitHub pages repo
This content is for https://firebog.net as well as my Big Blocklist Collection.

## Found a false positive, but don't know which list contains it?
Run `pihole -q -adlist blockeddomain.com`, and it will return the URL of the block list, opposed to `list.X.*.domains`.

## Know which list contains the false positive?
Click on the big blue "Toggle List Maintainer Sources" button to show the source of a particular blocklist. Via the source page, you should be able to find the contact details for the list maintainer. Get in touch with them to remove the false positive - if you're not able to find the maintainer's contact email, please feel free to get in touch with me.

## Unable to find the list maintainer, they're unresponsive, or have another issue?
Open a ticket here, and I'll be happy to see what I can do. Frustratingly, I don't regularly get GitHub notifications from my own repo - so feel free to ping me [via any listed contact method](https://firebog.net/about.html).
